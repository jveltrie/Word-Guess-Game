# Word-Guess-Game
This is a game of hangman with Wild Animals as the topic.
There are  four wild animals in the code that are the random choices.
You have 15 guesses to guess correctly.
If guessed correctly, an alert notifies you when you have correctly selected the last letter to complete the word.
If guessed incorrectly in allowed guesses, you get an alert notifying you need more zoo exposure.
I had difficulty trying to get the wins to change and I was not able to get the game to automatically reset.
I wanted to add images when words were correctly guessed, as you will see in the images folder, but I was not successful.
